  - [X] Pipelines
  - [ ] Tests
    - [ ] Operator platforms
      - [X] Minikube
      - [X] GKE
      - [ ] AWS
      - [X] OKD
    - [ ] Moodle unit test

## Install
Check out the [sample CR](config/samples/m4e_v1alpha1_m4e.yaml). Follow the next steps to first install the M4e Operator:
```bash
# install the operator
make deploy

# add a M4e object to instance a default moodle. The default image is inmutable. Extra plugins will be lost after pod replacement.
kubectl apply -f config/samples/m4e_v1alpha1_m4e.yaml

# follow/check M4e operator logs
kubectl -n m4e-operator-system logs -l control-plane=controller-manager -c manager  -f

# follow sample CR status
kubectl get M4e m4e-sample -o yaml -w
```

## Uninstall
Follow the next steps to uninstall it.
```bash
# delete the M4e object
# CAUTION with data loss
kubectl delete -f config/samples/m4e_v1alpha1_m4e.yaml

# uninstall the operator
make undeploy
```

## Admin password
To renew an admin's password, you can set a new value to `moodle_new_adminpass_hash` in M4e CR. Its value has to be a BCrypt compatible hash. You can generate one in the command line using python. For example, to generate a hash for the password 'changeme':
```bash
admin_pass=changeme
python -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'$admin_pass', bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=10)).decode('ascii'))"
```
